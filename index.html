				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Alternating Current (AC)</h3>
					<p>An electric current that reverses its polarity cyclically (switches positions in terms of its direction). The frequency is at 50-60hz depending on the countries. AC is caused by a rotating a magnet around the wire (an alternator).</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Alternator</h3>
					<p>An alternator is an electromechanical device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy in the form of alternating current. Most alternators use a rotating magnetic field with a stationary armature but occasionally, a rotating armature is used with a stationary magnetic field; or a linear alternator is used.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Amp (ampere)</h3>
					<p>The ampere is a measure of the amount of electric charge passing a point in an electric circuit per unit time with 6.241 × 1018 electrons, or one coulomb per second constituting one ampere. Unit of electric current equivalent to one volt applied across a resistance of one ohm (unit of electrical resistance).</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Anemometer</h3>
					<p>An instrument for measuring wind speed.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Asynschronous generator</h3>
					<p>Generator where alternating current frequency is not proportional to the speed of the generator rotor. An induction or asynchronous motor is an AC motor in which current is induced in the rotor winding by the magnetic field of the stator. Therefore they do not require the sliding electric contacts, such as a commutator or slip rings, which are needed to transfer current to the rotor winding in other types of motor such as the universal motor. Rotor windings consist of short-circuited loops of conductors and are made in two types: the wound rotor and the squirrel-cage rotor.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">

					<p>A rotor where variable pitch blades are attached to the hub without bearings.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Betz limit</h3>
					<p>In 1919 the physicist Albert Betz showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured. This Betz' law limit can be approached by modern turbine designs which may reach 70 to 80% of this theoretical limit.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Braking mechanism</h3>
					<p>Wind turbines are required to have two braking systems for emergency stoppage. The primary braking system for most modern wind turbines is the aerodynamic braking system, which essentially consists in turning the rotor blades about 90 degrees along their longitudinal axis (in the case of a pitch controlled turbine or an active stall controlled turbine), or in turning the rotor blade tips 90 degrees (in the case of a stall controlled turbine). These systems are usually spring operated, in order to work even in case of electrical power failure, and they are automatically activated if the hydraulic system in the turbine loses pressure. The mechanical brake is used as a back up. </p>
					</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Capacity factor</h3>
					<p>The net capacity factor of a power plant is the ratio of its actual output over a period of time, to its potential output if it were possible for it to operate at full nameplate capacity indefinitely. To calculate the capacity factor, take the total amount of energy the plant produced during a period of time and divide by the amount of energy the plant would have produced at full capacity. Capacity factors vary greatly depending on the type of fuel that is used and the design of the plant. The capacity factor should not be confused with the availability factor, capacity credit (firm capacity) or with efficiency.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers</h3>
					<p>Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic or carbon-fiber reinforced thermoplastic (CFRP, CRP, CFRTP or often simply carbon fiber), is an extremely strong and light fiber-reinforced polymer which contains carbon fibers. The polymer is most often epoxy, but other polymers, such as polyester, vinyl ester or nylon, are sometimes used. The composite may contain other fibers, such as aramid e.g. Kevlar, Twaron, aluminium, or glass fibers, as well as carbon fiber.</p>
				</div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Control system</h3><p>A computerised system to monitor the turbine's performance, including speed and direction of the wind, the levels of electrical power generation, the rotor speed, the blades’ pitch angle, vibration levels and the temperature of the lubricants. </p></div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Cost of Energy (CoE)</h3>
					<p>The cost of electricity (typically cents/kWh, Euro/kWh, Euro or $/MWh) generated by different sources is a calculation of the cost of generating electricity at the point of connection to a load or electricity grid. It includes the initial capital, discount rate, as well as the costs of continuous operation, fuel, and maintenance.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Curtailment</h3>
					<p>Stopping access of electricity produced from a source (such as a wind turbine) in order to prevent overload of the grid.</p>
				</div><div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Cyclic Pitch</h3>
					<p>The cyclic control is usually located between the pilot's legs and is commonly called the cyclic stick or just cyclic. On most helicopters, the cyclic is similar in appearance to a joystick in a conventional aircraft. The control is called the cyclic because it changes the pitch angle of the rotor blades cyclically. That is, the pitch or feathering angle of the rotor blades changes depending upon their position as they rotate around the hub.</p>
				</div><div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Darrieus Motor</h3>
					<p>The Darrieus wind turbine is a type of vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) used to generate electricity from the energy carried in the wind. The turbine consists of a number of aerofoils mounted on a rotating shaft or framework. This design of wind turbine was patented by Georges Jean Marie Darrieus, a French aeronautical engineer in 1931.</p>
				</div><div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Rotor diameter</h3>
					<p>The diameter the blades including the rotor tip. </p>
				</div><div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Direct Current (DC)</h3>
					<p>Direct current (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge. Direct current is produced by sources such as batteries, thermocouples, solar cells, and commutator-type electric machines of the dynamo type. Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC)</p>
				</div><div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Direct drive generator</h3>
					<p>A direct drive mechanism is one that takes the power coming from a motor without any reductions. Having fewer moving parts also means having fewer parts prone to failure. Failures in other systems are usually produced by aging of the component (such as a stretched belt), or stress. But  direct-drive mechanisms need a more precise control mechanism. Low voltage variations on a high-speed motor, which is reduced to low rpms can go unnoticed, but in a direct-drive, those variations are directly reflected on the rotational speed.</p>
				</div><div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)</h3>
					<p>Doubly fed electric machines are electric motors or electric generators that have windings on both stationary and rotating parts, where both windings transfer significant power between shaft and electrical system. Usually the stator winding is directly connected to the three-phase grid and the three-phase rotor winding is fed from the grid through a rotating or static frequency converter.

Doubly fed machines are typically used in applications that require varying speed of the machine's shaft in a limited range around the synchronous speed, for example ¬± 30%, because the power rating of the frequency converter is reduced similarly. Today doubly fed drives are the most common variable speed wind turbine concept.</p>
				</div><div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Gear ratio</h3>
					<p>The ratio of the number of revolution per minute between the main shaft and the output shaft of a wind turbine drive train.</p>
				</div><div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Generator</h3>
					<p>A generator uses the mechanical energy supplied to it to force the movement of electric charges present in the wire of its windings through an external electric circuit. electric charges could be induced by moving an electrical conductor, such as a wire that contains electric charges, in a magnetic field. This movement creates a voltage difference between the two ends of the wire or electrical conductor. This causes the electric charges to flow, thus generating electric current.</p>
				</div><div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>General Electric (GE)</h3>
					<p>GE's wind division first began as developer Zond in 1980 by James Dehlsen (who launched now-defunct Clipper Windpower). Enron acquired Zond and the German manufacturer Tacke in 1997. In 2002 GE acquired the wind power assets of Enron during its bankruptcy proceedings while gas turbine sales slumped. Enron Wind was the only surviving US manufacturer of large wind turbines at the time, and GE increased engineering and supplies for the Wind Division and doubled the annual sales to $1.2B in 2003.</p>
				</div><div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Gigawatt</h3>
					<p>1000 megawatts. Also see GW/h, the amount of energy produced over an hour. Usually, appears in the context of energy produced over a year. 1000GW = 1TW (Terawatt)</p>
				</div>
					<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Grid parity</h3>
					<p>Grid parity (or socket parity) when an alternative energy source can generate electricity at a levelised cost (LCoE) that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from the electricity grid. The term is most commonly used when discussing renewable energy sources, notably solar power and wind power.</p>
				</div>
					<div data-role="collapsible">

				<h3>In Phase</h3>
				<p>The output of the wind turbine genrator needs  to coincide exactly with the frequency of the grid.

					<h3>LVRT</h3>
					<p> low voltage ride through (LVRT), or fault ride through (FRT), is what an electric device, especially wind generator, may be required to be capable of when the voltage in the grid is temporarily reduced due to a fault or load change in the grid. The voltage may be reduced in one, two or all the three phases of the AC grid. The severity of the voltage dip is defined by the voltage level during the dip (may go down to zero) and the duration of the dip. If a wind turbine trips during such a voltage dip and becomes disconnected, then it will further weaken the overall stability of the grid, potentially causing more turbines to trip in a self-amplifying ripple effect. This effect is more severe in Doubly-fed Induction generators (DFIG).</p>

It is how rotation of a body is affected by Newton's law of inertia, which states "Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed." [1] In this context, inertia refers to resistance to change.Moment of inertia applies to an extended body in which the mass is constrained to rotate around an axis.

The relative motion between this field and the rotation of the rotor induces electric current in the conductive bars. In turn these currents lengthwise in the conductors react with the magnetic field of the motor to produce force acting at a tangent orthogonal to the rotor, resulting in torque to turn the shaft. In effect the rotor is carried around with the magnetic field but at a slightly slower rate of rotation.</p>
